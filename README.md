# Italy Coronavirus Cases by Age group and Sex (ICCAS)

This repository contains (unofficial) datasets about the number of Italian 
Sars-CoV-2 confirmed cases and deaths disaggregated by age group and sex. 
The data is (automatically) extracted from pdf reports 
(like [this](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Bollettino-sorveglianza-integrata-COVID-19_30-marzo-2020.pdf)) published by _Istituto Superiore di Sanità_ (ISS) each 3-4 days.
A link to the most recent report can be found in [this page](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-sorveglianza-dati)
under section "Documento esteso".

The code for downloading ISS reports and for generating all datasets is also included.

Hopefully, ISS or other institutions will release more detailed 
machine-readable data making this repository useless. 

## Data folder structure
The `data` folder is structured as follows:
```
data
├── single-date                     
│   └── iccas_only_{date}.csv  Dataset with data from the report of {date}
└── iccas_full.csv             Dataset with data extracted from all reports
```

## Description
For each report, data is extracted from a single table (it has been "Table 1").
The table contains the number of all confirmed cases and deaths disaggregated 
by age group (0-9, 10-19, ..., 80-89, >=90) and sex.

**WARNING**: the sum of male and female cases is **not** equal to the total 
number of cases, since the sex of some cases is unknown.

Columns can be divided into four groups:
- "index columns": `date` (missing in `iccas_only_{date}.csv` datasets) and `age_group`;
- columns about males, starting with `male_`;
- columns about females, starting with `female_`;
- columns with totals (males + females + **unknown sex**).

Below, `{sex}` can be `male` or `female`.

| Column                    | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `date`                    | **(Only present in `iccas_full.csv`)** Date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`                        |
| `age_group`               | Values: `"0-9", "10-19", ..., "80-89", ">=90"`                                               |
| `cases`                   | Number of confirmed cases (both sexes + unknown-sex; active + closed)                        |
| `deaths`                  | number of deaths (both sexes + unknown-sex)                                                  |
| `{sex}_cases`             | number of cases of sex {sex} (relative to the age group)                                     |
| `{sex}_deaths`            | number of cases of sex {sex} (relative to the age group) ended up in death                   |
| `cases_percentage`        | `100 * cases / cases_of_all_ages`                                                            |
| `deaths_percentage`       | `100 * deaths / deaths_of_all_ages`                                                          |
| `fatality_rate`           | `100 * deaths / cases`                                                                       |
| `{sex}_cases_percentage`  | `100 * {sex}_cases / (male_cases + female_cases)` (cases of unknown sex excluded)            |
| `{sex}_deaths_percentage` | `100 * {sex}_deaths / (male_deaths + female_deaths)` (cases of unknown sex excluded)         | 
| `{sex}_fatality_rate`     | `100 * {sex}_deaths / {sex}_cases`                                                           |

All columns that can be computed from cases and death counts (bottom half of the table above) were 
all re-computed to increase precision.

## Reading with `pandas`
```python 
import pandas as pd

# Reading a single-date dataset
single = pd.read_csv('iccas_only_2020-03-30.csv', index_col='age_group')   # or index_col=0

# Reading the full dataset
full = pd.read_csv('iccas_full.csv', index_col=('date', 'age_group'))  # or index_col=(0, 1)
```

## About the code

I tried to automate as much as possible, more for the sake of "exercising" than for convenience
(I took this as a kind of didactical project); but of course, if ISS don't make crazy changes, the
automation should work fine for a while.

Here is how it works.

### ISS reports retrieval
The [ISS news page](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/aggiornamenti) 
is parsed to obtain the links to all PDF reports (see `download_reports.py`) 
and if new reports are found they are downloaded into the `reports` folder 
(reports are not included in the git repository because they take MBs).

### Data extraction
For each report, the page containing the table is found by extracting the text from 
each page (using [PyPDF3](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF3)) and using a regular 
expression to match the table caption.

Then, the table is extracted from the page using [tabula-py](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py)* 
with "tabula templates", i.e. JSON files describing where the table is located (page and selection area).
Since the page containing the table is automatically detected, only the "selection area" is actually used.

Templates are stored in the `tabula-templates` folder as `{date of first validity}.tabula-template.json`
and are created using the [Tabula app](https://tabula.technology/) by loading a document 
and manually selecting the area of interest. Fortunately, the table area location has been stable so I had
to repeat this manual step only two times.

(*) I quickly tried to extract the table by parsing the text extracted by `PyPDF3` but
the solution required some "hacks", so in the end I preferred using `tabula-py`.

### Post-processing and file generation
At this point we have a dataframe for each report. All columns that can be computed from absolute 
case/death counts are recomputed to increase precision (do I really need to do that? Probably not). 

A `pandas.DataFrame` for the full dataset is created by concatenating all single-date dataframes 
and defining a multi-index `(date, age_group)`.

All datasets are generated using `pandas.to_csv`.
