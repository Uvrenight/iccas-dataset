# Italy Coronavirus Cases by Age group and Sex (ICCAS)

_[Leggilo in italiano](README.it.md)._

This repository contains datasets about the number of Italian Sars-CoV-2 
confirmed cases and deaths disaggregated by age group and sex. 
The data is (automatically) extracted from pdf reports 
(like [this](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/bollettino/Bollettino-sorveglianza-integrata-COVID-19_30-marzo-2020.pdf)) 
published by _Istituto Superiore di Sanità_ (ISS).
A link to the most recent report can be found in [this page](https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-sorveglianza-dati)
under section "Documento esteso".

Reports were originally published twice per week; since april, they are 
published only once per week. There may be exception to this schedule though, 
e.g. in august.

I wrote a script that is run periodically in order to automatically update 
this repository when a new report is published. 
You can find the code in [this repository](https://github.com/janLuke/iccas-code).


## Data folder structure
The `data` folder is structured as follows:
```
data
├── by-date                    
│   └── iccas_{date}.csv   Dataset with cases/deaths updated to 4 p.m. of {date}
└── iccas_full.csv         Dataset with data from all reports (by date)
```
The full dataset is obtained by concatenating all datasets in `by-date` and has
an additional `date` column. If you use `pandas`, I suggest you to read the file
using the first or the first two columns as index (resp. `date` and `age_group`):
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('iccas_full.csv', index_col=('date', 'age_group'))  # or (0, 1)
``` 

**NOTE:** `{date}` is the date the data refers to, NOT the release date of the report 
it was extracted from: as written above, a report is usually released with a day 
of delay. For example, `iccas_2020-03-19.csv` contains data relative to 2020-03-19 
which was extracted from the report published in 2020-03-20.


## Dataset details
Each dataset in the `by-date` folder contains the same data you can find in 
"Table 1" of the corresponding ISS report.
This table contains the number of confirmed cases, deaths and other derived
information disaggregated by age group (0-9, 10-19, ..., 80-89, >=90) and sex.

**WARNING**: the sum of male and female cases is **not** equal to the total 
number of cases, since the sex of some cases is unknown. The same applies to deaths.

Below, `{sex}` can be `male` or `female`.

| Column                    | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `date`                    | **(Only in `iccas_full.csv`)** Date the format `YYYY-MM-DD`; numbers are updated to 4 p.m of this date |
| `age_group`               | Values: `"0-9", "10-19", ..., "80-89", ">=90", unknown`                                      |
| `cases`                   | Number of confirmed cases (both sexes + unknown-sex; active + closed)                        |
| `deaths`                  | Number of deaths (both sexes + unknown-sex)                                                  |
| `{sex}_cases`             | Number of cases for {sex}                                                                    |
| `{sex}_deaths`            | Number of cases ended up in death for {sex}                                                  |
| `cases_percentage`        | `100 * cases / <cases_of_all_ages>`                                                          |
| `deaths_percentage`       | `100 * deaths / <deaths_of_all_ages>`                                                        |
| `fatality_rate`           | `100 * deaths / cases`                                                                       |
| `{sex}_cases_percentage`  | `100 * {sex}_cases / (male_cases + female_cases)`                                            |
| `{sex}_deaths_percentage` | `100 * {sex}_deaths / (male_deaths + female_deaths)`                                         | 
| `{sex}_fatality_rate`     | `100 * {sex}_deaths / {sex}_cases`                                                           |

All columns that can be computed from absolute counts of cases and deaths (bottom 
half of the table above) were all re-computed.
